# Task Descriptions

This page collects the description of the PoliCTF 2017 challenges, the downloadable files, and links to the authors' writeups, when available. Further, community-contributed, writeups are available on [CTFTime](https://ctftime.org/event/425/tasks/) (feel free to add your own!).

A note for the challenges with a server-side component: the challenges are not running after the end of the competition, and the host referred in the description is not reachable anymore. For some challenges meant to be solved black-box, we release the server-side sources so that it's possible to deploy them and solve them.
