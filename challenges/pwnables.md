### Status Box [120 points, 90 solves]

<p>This Box memorizes a statuses sequence composed by a current status and all the previous ones. It already contains a small sequence of statuses, but you can show only the current one. You can set a new status, modify the current one or delete it: in this way the box goes back to the previous one in the sequence. The box can keep track of maximum 200 statuses. It seems just to work fine, even though we didn't test it a lot...;</p><p>nc statusbox.chall.polictf.it 31337</p>

<b>Server-side source code:</b> [statusBoxService.zip](/files/statusBoxService.zip) (the challenge was meant to be solved black-box: this file was not provided to the players!)
