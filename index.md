{{ site.polictf }} 2017 is the third edition of our online jeopardy-style capture the flag competition, organized with love by the Tower of Hanoi CTF team and open to everyone!

For the latest news, stay tuned (and follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/towerofhanoi))!

### Who are we?

We are [Tower of Hanoi](http://toh.necst.it).
We are a team of [B.Sc|M.Sc.|Ph.D] students and alumni
from Politecnico di Milano, with a lively interest in topics pertaining computer security, cryptography
and general technical prowess.
After taking part in a number of computer security contests, in 2012 we had a sudden enlightenment and
thought about organizing one ourselves.
It seems we survived, so we're organizing the third edition of the contest :)
