<p>{{ site.polictf }} is an online jeopardy-style capture the flag competition, open to everyone.</p>

<p>The competition will be held during the summer of 2017. The date will be announced very soon - stay tuned (and follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/towerofhanoi">twitter</a>!)</p>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>

<p>We are <a href="http://toh.necst.it">Tower of Hanoi</a>. We are a team of [B.Sc|M.Sc.|Ph.D] students and alumni
from Politecnico di Milano, with a lively interest in topics pertaining computer security, cryptography and general technical prowess.
After taking part in a number of computer security contests, in 2012 we had a sudden enlightenment and thought about organizing one ourselves.
It seems we survived, so we're organizing the third edition of the contest :)</p>
