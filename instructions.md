# Instructions

Capture The Flags (CTFs) are competitions that involve many aspects of information security: 
cryptography, steganography, binary analysis, reverse engineering, mobile security and others.

There are two common CTF styles: jeopardy and attack-defense.
{{ site.polictf }} is a jeopardy CTF: teams are presented with a set of specific questions (i.e., challenges) in a range of categories.

* The objective of each challenge is to recover a special string called flag.
* {{ site.polictf }} flags are in the format `flag{}`. The whole string including `flag{` and `}` needs to be submitted as flag.
* Teams gain points for every solved challenge.
* Some challenges may be initially locked, and can be opened only after some team solve unlocked challenges.
